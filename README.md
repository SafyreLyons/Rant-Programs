# Rant Programs
Apps I make when I need to express something

These apps are NOT to be taken with seriousness

Any remark to suicide is just put down to express what I am dealing with, I (thanks to my loving family and amazing friends) have proper avenues such as a therapist and quickly ranting to people. Without my friends and family this repository would have never been made and I would be dead. Thanks to all who keep me happy enough and stable enough to be alive, and to those who have been giving me the proper treatement I need. I just needed another avenue to use to quickly type out code and share it to look back on later.

*Be safe, be strong, find ways to healthily express your issues. Thats why I made this repo, to have a healthy way to express! If you want to share code here, just email **lyo.saf@yandex.com**! <3*
